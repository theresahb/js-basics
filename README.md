1. JavaScript can be run outside of a web browser using a JavaScript runtime environment. Some popular JavaScript runtime environments include Node.js, Deno, and Rhino. These environments allow JavaScript code to be run on servers, desktop applications, and even IoT devices.


2. Manipulate HTML and CSS: JavaScript can dynamically manipulate the content and style of HTML and CSS on a webpage, making it possible to create dynamic and interactive web pages.

Handle user interaction: JavaScript can handle user events, such as mouse clicks, keyboard presses, and form submissions, allowing web pages to respond to user input in real-time.

Communicate with servers: JavaScript can use APIs to communicate with servers, allowing web pages to fetch and send data without reloading the page.

Create browser-based games: JavaScript can be used to create interactive games and animations that run in the browser, either natively or with the help of game engines and libraries.

Build web and mobile applications: JavaScript can be used with frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue to build complex web and mobile applications that run in the browser or as native mobile apps using tools like React Native or Ionic.


3. The first version of ECMAScript was released in June 1997 and was known as ECMAScript 1 (or ES1). 


4. In JavaScript, you can use the 'console.log()' method to log messages, variables, and other data to the console.

6. Statically typed and dynamically typed programming languages refer to how a programming language handles data types. Here's the difference between them:

Statically typed programming languages require variables to be declared with a specific data type before they can be used. The data type of a variable is determined at compile time, and any type violations will be caught during compilation. Examples of statically typed languages include C, C++, Java, and Go.

Dynamically typed programming languages do not require variables to be declared with a specific data type before they can be used. The data type of a variable is determined at runtime, and type violations are caught during runtime. Examples of dynamically typed languages include JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and PHP.


7. In JavaScript, both 'null' and 'undefined' represent the absence of a value. 

'undefined' is a primitive data type that is automatically assigned to a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value. It is also the default return value of a function that does not return a value.

'null' is a primitive data type that represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is often used to signify that a variable or object property should have no value or is unknown.

'undefined' is automatically assigned to a variable that has been declared but has no value, or to a function that does not return a value, while 'null' is a value that is explicitly assigned to represent the intentional absence of an object value.
